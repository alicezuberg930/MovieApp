This tragedy fuels José Inocêncio’s anger, blaming João Pedro for the loss of his great love. Throughout their lives, indifference and resentment mark the relationship between the father and his youngest son. As if the past weren’t enough, years later, the arrival of the mysterious Mariana puts all these emotions to the test when both father and son fall in love with the same woman. This situation reawakens feelings that were either dormant or previously unknown to them.",

After losing her parents as a kid, she travels around the country with tinker Jang Won and grows up as a strong woman full of courage.

Meanwhile, there is Yeo Eui Ju, a man who gets on her nerves by loafing around her. As a soldier, he is more logical rather than empathetic, but he passes out whenever he gets drunk.
